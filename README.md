-   `inputs/data` contains the data file to be used for analysis.
-   `inputs/literature` contains the original paper.
-   `outputs/data` contains three cleaned datasets.
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, save and test data.




## LLM Usage

In the development of this paper, a Large Language Model, specifically Chat-GPT3.5, was employed for providing a idea of the coding components and a first draft of narrative composition. 

The entire chat history can be found in `inputs/llm/usage.txt`.
