#  Revisiting the generalized linear models for MPs ingestion in fishes

## Overview

This repo contains the code and data to produce 1) a paper which is a reproduction of https://github.com/GCov/A-Bayesian-analysis-of-the-factors-determining-microplastics-ingestion-in-fishes.git. 2) replications of the generalized linear models and some plots.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:


-   `inputs/llm` contains the chat history with Chat-GPT3.5.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document - paper.qmd, the PDF of the reproduction paper - paper.pdf, and reference bibliography file - references.bib.
-   `inputs/data` contains the data file to be used for analysis and in appendix figures.
-   `inputs/literature` contains the original paper.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document - paper.qmd, the PDF of the reproduction paper - paper.pdf, and reference bibliography file - references.bib.
-   `replication/scripts` contains the code used to replicate each of the figures.
-   `replication/plots` contains the replicated figures.
-   `replication/helper_functions` contains



## LLM Usage

In the development of this paper, a Large Language Model, specifically Chat-GPT3.5, was employed for providing a idea of the coding components and a first draft of narrative composition. The entire chat history can be found in `inputs/llm/usage.txt`.
